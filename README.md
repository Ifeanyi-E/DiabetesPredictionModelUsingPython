Project Title: Diabetes Prediction Model

Problem Statement

Stark Health Clinic aims to improve diabetes prediction and prevention by developing a robust machine learning model. The goal is to accurately identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes, enabling timely interventions and better patient outcomes.

Data

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

•	gender: Gender of the individual (e.g., 'Male', 'Female').

•	age: Age of the individual in years.

•	hypertension: Whether the individual has hypertension (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

•	heart_disease: Whether the individual has heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

•	smoking_history: Smoking history of the individual (never, former, current).

•	bmi: Body Mass Index of the individual.

•	HbA1c_level: Hemoglobin A1c level, indicating average blood sugar levels.

•	blood_glucose_level: Current blood glucose level of the individual.

•	diabetes: Target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Data Preprocessing

The data undergoes preprocessing steps, including:

•	Handling Missing Values: There were no missing values in the data.

•	Handling Duplicates: There were duplicates which was dropped

•	Feature Analysis: Univariate and Bivariate analysis was carried out to understand the features better

•	Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

•	Feature Scaling: Standardizing numerical features to ensure fair comparison was done using Standard scaler.

•	Encoding Categorical Features: Converting categorical features into numerical format using label encoding.

Model Selection and Training

Several machine learning algorithms were explored, including:

•	Logistic Regression

•	SGD Classifier

•	Random Forest

•	Decision Tree

•	XGBoost

After hyperparameter tuning, the SGD Classifier demonstrated the best performance based on the Recall metric. Recall is particularly important in this context as it measures the model's ability to correctly identify individuals with diabetes. A high recall score ensures that fewer individuals with diabetes are missed, leading to earlier intervention and better health outcomes.

Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1.	Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).

2.	Model Training: Training the selected model on the preprocessed training data.

3.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.

Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using various metrics:

•	Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified instances.

•	Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.

•	Recall: Proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.

•	F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

•	Confusion Matrix: A table showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions.

•	ROC Curve: A graphical representation of the model's performance at various classification thresholds.

Deployment

The trained model can be deployed in various ways, such as:

•	Web Application: Creating a web application to allow users to input patient data and receive predictions.

•	API: Developing a REST API to expose the model as a service for integration with other systems.

•	Cloud Deployment: Deploying the model to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalable and accessible predictions.

Additional Considerations

•	Data Privacy and Security: Ensure that patient data is handled securely and ethically, complying with relevant regulations.

•	Model Interpretability: Use techniques like SHAP or LIME to understand the factors influencing the model's predictions.

•	Continuous Monitoring and Improvement: Regularly monitor the model's performance and retrain it as needed to maintain accuracy and reliability.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of machine learning, Stark Health can significantly improve its ability to predict and prevent diabetes, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
